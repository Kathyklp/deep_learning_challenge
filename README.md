Module 21
I’m sorry there are so many files. I am having trouble with Github.
Please use the following files that are the most up-to-date:

I am submitting this again to make sure that I included the correct html link. I was not able to use the website url submission.

 I received this from Cortney Totty: “In order for an assignment to count towards gradution, it requires any score above 0. Regarding the rubric and challenge grade you are correct. Your score is is based on the rubric.” I am sure I have completed enough to get the one point required to get credit for the assignment. 
I will complete the assignments later, on my own. I need to ensure that I have one point on each assignment to graduate. Based on the rubric I completed the following:
Requirements
Preprocess the Data (30 points)
Create a dataframe containing the charity_data.csv data , and identify the target and feature variables in the dataset (2 points)      completed
Drop the EIN and NAME columns (2 points)   
Determine the number of unique values in each column (2 points)  completed
For columns with more than 10 unique values, determine the number of data points for each unique value (4 points) 
Create a new value called Other that contains rare categorical variables (5 points)
Create a feature array, X, and a target array, y by using the preprocessed data (5 points)
Split the preprocessed data into training and testing datasets (5 points)
Scale the data by using a StandardScaler that has been fitted to the training data (5 points)

Thank you for your time. Kathy
